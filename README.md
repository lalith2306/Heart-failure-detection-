Heart Failure Prediction Project
Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

age: Age of the patient
sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp: Chest pain type (1-4)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1-3)
ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
num: Diagnosis of heart disease (0 = no disease; 1 = disease present)

Steps:
1.Load the dataset
2.Open the code notebook
3.Run the code
4.Enter the input values to obtain the predictions on the input data

Best Model
The Logistic Regression model emerged as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 0.83, indicating its suitability for predicting heart failure in this dataset.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms to a medical dataset for predicting heart failure. The Logistic Regression model was identified as the most accurate and reliable model for this task.
